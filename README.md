Tidying UCI HAR Dataset, peer assessment Getting and Cleaning Data
Edit your working directory to the location where you pasted UCI HAR dataset

The code works as follows:
-	First it makes the paths to acess information on the UCI HAR Dataset structure
-	Then it loads the data, loading first just a part of it, analysing the variable class and losding the whole of it
-	Data is organised according to explanation by David Hood, COMMUNITY TA
-	Then columns are named, with descriptive names
-	Variables not providing information on the mean or std are removed from the dataset
-	Then we get the requested output, summary of parameters.
